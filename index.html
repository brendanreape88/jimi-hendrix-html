          <p>
            James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November
            27, 1942 â€“ September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer, and
            songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years,
            he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric
            guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most
            celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of
            Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the
            history of rock music".[1] <br /><br />Born in Seattle, Washington,
            Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted
            in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon
            afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing
            gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers'
            backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued
            to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the
            Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas
            Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix
            had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience:
            "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved
            fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in
            1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric
            Ladyland, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's
            most commercially successful release and his first and only number
            one album. The world's highest-paid performer,[2] he headlined the
            Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970
            before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related
            asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
